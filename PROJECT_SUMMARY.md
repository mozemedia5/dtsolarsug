---

## 🔑 Important Information

### Firebase Configuration

Your Firebase API keys are configured but **NOT EXPOSED** in the code:

```
Project ID: dt-solars
Auth Domain: dt-solars.firebaseapp.com
```

The keys are stored in `.env` file which is:
- ✅ In `.gitignore` (not committed to GitHub)
- ✅ Secure
- ✅ Can be set as environment variables in deployment

### GitHub Repository

**Repository:** `https://github.com/mozemedia5/dtsolarsug`

**Branches:**
- `main` - Customer-facing website (your original website)
- `admin` - Administration dashboard (new)

Both branches are pushed to GitHub and ready to use!

## 🚀 How to Set Up the Admin Dashboard

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase

1. **Go to Firebase Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select your project:** dt-solars
3. **Enable Authentication:**
   - Click "Authentication" → "Get Started"
   - Enable "Email/Password" sign-in method

4. **Enable Cloud Firestore:**
   - Click "Firestore Database" → "Create Database"
   - Choose "Start in production mode"
   - Select your region

5. **Set Firestore Security Rules:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Admin users
    match /admins/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'super_admin';
    }
    
    // Products - anyone can read, only admins can write
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Promotions
    match /promotions/{promotionId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Reviews
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if true;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create Super Admin Account

**Option A: In Firebase Console**

1. Go to Authentication → Users → Add User
2. Email: `administrator@dt-solars.com`
3. Password: Choose a strong password (e.g., `Admin@123456`)
4. Copy the UID

5. Go to Firestore Database → Start Collection
6. Collection ID: `admins`
7. Document ID: (paste the UID)
8. Add fields:
   - `uid`: (paste UID again)
   - `email`: `administrator@dt-solars.com`
   - `role`: `super_admin`
   - `displayName`: `Super Administrator`
   - `createdAt`: (current timestamp)
   - `isActive`: `true`

**Option B: Using Code (when admin dashboard is running)**

You can use the initialization function in the code to create the super admin.

### Step 3: Deploy Admin Dashboard

**For Testing Locally:**
```bash
git checkout admin
npm install
npm run dev
```

**For Production Deployment:**

You can deploy to:
- Cloudflare Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Firebase Hosting

All platforms require setting environment variables:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

### Step 4: Login and Start Managing

1. Open your admin dashboard URL
2. Login with: `administrator@dt-solars.com` and your password
3. Start adding products, promotions, and managing reviews!
